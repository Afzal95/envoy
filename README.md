In our group we equally divided the work for our Unit-1 project, i.e Envoy.com. I took the responsibility of building the index page. It contains 6 diffrenet sections and I have given my level best to make it look and work like the Envoy website in its full screen size. Apart from layouts , in this page, each and every section and every icons have link to some some other page.I have embedded it all. With time I got to know about many add-ons and tools that enabled me to work faster with time. I have to admit , I learned a lot more while building this project than I could ever have reading documentations.
